# ðŸ’¼ Employee Salary Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts **annual employee salary** based on multiple factors such as **education**, **experience**, **country**, **job role**, and **organization size**.  
The model is trained using **Gradient Boosting Regressor**, fine-tuned with `GridSearchCV` for optimal performance, and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit** web application.  
It also integrates a **live currency conversion API** to display salaries in INR and other currencies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Predicts salary based on **multiple job and demographic factors**.
- **Ethical consideration** â€“ Avoids using sensitive attributes like age to prevent discrimination.
- **Live currency conversion** using [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/).
- Fine-tuned **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for improved accuracy.
- User-friendly **Streamlit** web interface.
- **Downloadable CSV** of prediction results.
- Developed in **Google Colab**, deployed locally or via **pyngrok** for remote testing.

## ðŸ“Š Model Development

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical features using **LabelEncoder** and **One-Hot Encoding**.
- Created interaction features like:
  - `Edu_Exp` = Education Ã— Experience
  - `Country_Exp` = Country Ã— Experience

### **2. Model Selection**
- Compared multiple models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor** (Selected as best performer)

### **3. Fine-Tuning**
Used **GridSearchCV** to find the best hyperparameters:
python
n_estimators: [100, 200]
learning_rate: [0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
max_depth: [3, 5, 7]

4. Best Model
Tuned Gradient Boosting Regressor
RÂ² Score: 0.59
MAE: 21,342.58
RMSE: 28,437.08
